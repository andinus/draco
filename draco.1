.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm draco
.Ar <url>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a script to convert reddit thread to Org document. It accepts a url
& prints the Org document to STDOUT.

It'll also print comments along with their replies. It's limited by
the reddit API.
.Pp
.Sh NOTES
Draco will add 2 spaces before every new line. Comments/Posts may
contain `*' at the start of line & that confuses Org. Org might
interpret it as a new heading so we add a space before every new line.

All text will be wrapped at 76 characters, including 2 spaces before
every new line the maximum number of columns becomes 78.
.Pp
.Sh WHY?
I reference things from the web in my Journal & don't want those links
to break so I save them locally. Previously I used to manually archive
the whole thread, this automates it.
